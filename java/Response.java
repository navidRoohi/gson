Comprised of habitat neighborhoods like ritzy Sahara Square and frigid Tundratown, it's a melting pot where animals from every environment live together-a place where no matter what you are, from the biggest elephant to the smallest shrew, you can be anything. But when rookie Officer Judy Hopps (voice of Ginnifer Goodwin) arrives, she discovers that being the first bunny on a police force of big, tough animals isn't so easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a case, even if it means partnering with a fast-talking, scam-artist fox, Nick Wilde (voice of Jason Bateman), to solve the mystery. Walt Disney Animation Studios' \"Zootopia,\" a comedy-adventure directed by Byron Howard (\"Tangled,\" \"Bolt\") and Rich Moore (\"Wreck-It Ralph,\" \"The Simpsons\") and co-directed by Jared Bush (\"Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero\"), opens in theaters on March 4, 2016.

New England, 1630. Upon threat of banishment by the church, an English farmer leaves his colonial plantation, relocating his wife and five children to a remote plot of land on the edge of an ominous forest - within which lurks an unknown evil. Strange and unsettling things begin to happen almost immediately - animals turn malevolent, crops fail, and one child disappears as another becomes seemingly possessed by an evil spirit. With suspicion and paranoia mounting, family members accuse teenage daughter Thomasin of witchcraft, charges she adamantly denies. As circumstances grow more treacherous, each family member's faith, loyalty and love become tested in shocking and unforgettable ways. Writer/director Robert Eggers' debut feature, which premiered to great acclaim at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival - winning the Best Director Prize in the U.S. Narrative Competition - painstakingly recreates a God-fearing New England decades before the 1692 Salem witch trials, in which religious convictions tragically turned to mass hysteria. Told through the eyes of the adolescent Thomasin - in a star-making turn by newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy - and supported by mesmerizing camera work and a powerful musical score, THE WITCH is a chilling and groundbreaking new take on the genre.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/JqlqRjhOUodh84jiwUalBfqiAA0=/54x80/v1.bTsxMTM0ODk1MjtqOzE3MDAzOzIwNDg7NTQwOzgwMA","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/JqlqRjhOUodh84jiwUalBfqiAA0=/54x80/v1.bTsxMTM0ODk1MjtqOzE3MDAzOzIwNDg7NTQwOzgwMA","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/JqlqRjhOUodh84jiwUalBfqiAA0=/54x80/v1.bTsxMTM0ODk1MjtqOzE3MDAzOzIwNDg7NTQwOzgwMA","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/JqlqRjhOUodh84jiwUalBfqiAA0=/54x80/v1.bTsxMTM0ODk1MjtqOzE3MDAzOzIwNDg7NTQwOzgwMA"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Anya Taylor-Joy","id":"771500371","characters":["Thomasin"]},{"name":"Ralph Ineson","id":"770771762","characters":["William"]},{"name":"Kate Dickie","id":"381421664","characters":["Katherine"]},{"name":"Harvey Scrimshaw","id":"771385959","characters":["Caleb"]},{"name":"Ellie Grainger","id":"771628891","characters":["Mercy"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"4263482"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771412296.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_witch_2016/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771412296/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771412296/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771412296/similar.json"}}]

     * synopsis : The modern mammal metropolis of Zootopia is a city like no other. Comprised of habitat neighborhoods like ritzy Sahara Square and frigid Tundratown, it's a melting pot where animals from every environment live together-a place where no matter what you are, from the biggest elephant to the smallest shrew, you can be anything. But when rookie Officer Judy Hopps (voice of Ginnifer Goodwin) arrives, she discovers that being the first bunny on a police force of big, tough animals isn't so easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a case, even if it means partnering with a fast-talking, scam-artist fox, Nick Wilde (voice of Jason Bateman), to solve the mystery. Walt Disney Animation Studios' "Zootopia," a comedy-adventure directed by Byron Howard ("Tangled," "Bolt") and Rich Moore ("Wreck-It Ralph," "The Simpsons") and co-directed by Jared Bush ("Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero"), opens in theaters on March 4, 2016. Officer Judy Hopps (voice of Ginnifer Goodwin), the very first bunny on Zootopia's police force, jumps at the opportunity to crack her first case-even if it means partnering with fast-talking, scam-artist fox Nick Wilde (voice of Jason Bateman) to solve the mystery.
